Please note that while the logo belongs to Bibliomation, none of the content is necessarily representative or accurate to Bibliomation. This is purely a practice project.

## Development server

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
